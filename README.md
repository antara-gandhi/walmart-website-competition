   *Design and code a website that showcases your idea for Walmartâ€™s next innovation! Read on for background on how Walmart has served their community and some of their most creative solutions for their customers to get ideas.*

  - *Your site can use your preferred language and should be thoughtful, well-designed, and creative.*
  - *You can submit your code as an attachment to your submission or use an open platform.*
  - *Your site should include text, images, and some interactive components (such as links, buttons, quizzes, etc).*
