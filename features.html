        <h2 style="background-color: #1E64AC";>Health</h2>
        <p>Walmart is dedicated to the health and safety of our customers. That is why Wheely includes a biometric handle.</p>
        <p>With this feature, and the customer's consent, Wheely will track your: 
          <ul>
            <li>Heart rate</li>
            <li>Temperature</li>
            <li>Speed</li>
          </ul></p>
        <p>Doing so will allow us to compare it for sudden spikes or drops and, in that case, alert our associates for possible emergencies.</p>
        <p>Wheely also includes a general "Call for Help" button, in case you need an associates assistance ASAP.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="family">
        <h2 style="background-color: #1E64AC";>Family</h2>
        <p>Walmart understands the need to shop quickly and effeciently for all your family needs. That is why you can scan as you shop, pay at the cart, and opt for a self-driving cart.</p>
        <p>We also understand that we have to move slower for our little ones. That is why our self-driving option also includes a slower auto-speed for a more relaxed and safe shopping experience.</p>
        <p>Check out more about these features <a href="index.html">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Additionally, you can now take Wheely out to your car when you're all set. Once you've unloaded, press "All Set" and Wheely will return to the nearest parking lot cart holder!</p>
